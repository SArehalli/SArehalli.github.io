Tutorials, Slide decks, and other materials that might be useful to people getting into computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, or something similar. As a warning, slide decks were designed to be used as a visual aid in a presentation, so not all of the necessary detail is preserved in the slides alone. 

## Tutorials
[Training LSTM Language Models for Psycholinguistics (WIP)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EYQQ5Zjt7TNuRIjg_y-L-8m2_T5JRIig?usp=sharing). A walkthrough (with commentary) of the code used by [Gulordava et al. (2018)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1108.pdf) to train LSTM language models with a focus on psycholinguistic evaluation.

[Psycholinguistic Evaluation of Language Models](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yzO4isSfBKq6YBLHzZSZmllDQB_yOWiM?usp=sharing). A tutorial designed for a Computational Psycholinguistics class at JHU CogSci (2018) to introduce the techniques necessary for psycholinguistic evaluation of neural language models.

## Slide Decks

[Memory and Language Processing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/188Ddj3fjiUpSsjUQMU8ewnM98Ec_pc4fGNYlYkwbhk0/edit?usp=sharing). Slide deck from a guest lecture in JHU CogSci's Computational Psycholinguistics class (2019) on the relationship between models of memory and language processing (ACT-R, Interference Effects, etc.).

[Introduction to Language Processing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IivPhHP8VL1danY6C2ELFuX-tkneH5ylvbQ70oGQoks/edit?usp=sharing). Slide deck from a guest lecture in JHU CogSci's Language and Mind class introducing students to the core methods and ideas in psycholinguistics (Competence/Performance, Lexical Priming, Automaticity, Incremental Parsing, etc.). 

[Variational Inference in ML](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VIsjI2FLbEIJnu_Uhu6ARUnpBrJffr1go9BRhTpUAaM/edit?usp=sharing). Slide deck from a presentation in the JHU CAP Lab Lab Meeting (June 2019) motivating and introducing Variational Inference as a tool for unsupervised learning.
